## Pulsar

<blockquote>
Most neutron stars are observed as pulsars. 
Pulsars are rotating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a> 
observed to have pulses of radiation at very regular intervals 
that typically range from milliseconds to seconds. Pulsars have very strong magnetic fields 
which funnel jets of particles out along the two magnetic poles. These accelerated particles 
produce very powerful beams of light. Often, the magnetic field is not aligned with the spin axis, 
so those beams of particles and light are swept around as the star rotates. 
When the beam crosses our line-of-sight, we see a pulse, in other words, 
we see pulsars turn on and off as the beam sweeps over Earth. &mdash;
