In the section 
[Traveling Waves](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_I_-_Mechanics_Sound_Oscillations_and_Waves_(OpenStax)/16%3A_Waves/16.02%3A_Traveling_Waves)
from [phys.libretexts.org](https://phys.libretexts.org/), we can read that

<blockquote>
<p>A <b>wave</b> is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. 
There are three basic types of waves: mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves, and matter waves.
Some examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound
waves, and seismic waves.</p>

<p>Basic <b>mechanical waves</b> are governed by Newtonâ€™s laws and require a medium. 
A medium is the substance a mechanical waves propagates through, and the medium produces an elastic
restoring force when it is deformed. Mechanical waves transfer energy and momentum, 
without transferring mass. [&hellip;] </p>

<p><b>Electromagnetic waves</b> are associated with oscillations in electric and magnetic fields and do 
not require a medium. Examples include gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet waves, visible light, 
infrared waves, microwaves, and radio waves. [&hellip;] </p>

<p><b>Matter waves</b> are a central part of the branch of physics
known as quantum mechanics. These waves are associated with protons, electrons, neutrons, and other fundamental
particles found in nature. [&hellip;] </p>
