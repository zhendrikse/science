## Rutherford scattering
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

<blockquote>
The Geigerâ€“Marsden experiments (also called the Rutherford gold foil experiment) were a landmark series 
of experiments by which scientists learned that every atom has a nucleus where all of its positive charge 
and most of its mass is concentrated. They deduced this after measuring how an alpha particle beam is 
scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. &mdash;

In this animation, a disk is used as source of alpha particles which scatter off gold nucleus.
The position of the gold nucleus changes as the alpha particles pass by, but it is
repositioned after each event.
