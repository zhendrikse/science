## [Barnsley&apos;s fern](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern) &mdash; an iterated function system (IFS) fractal
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

<blockquote>
IFSs provide models for certain plants, leaves, and ferns, by virtue of the self-similarity which often occurs 
in branching structures in nature. But nature also exhibits randomness and variation from one level to the next; 
no two ferns are exactly alike, and the branching fronds become leaves at a smaller scale. 
V-variable fractals allow for such randomness and variability across scales, while at the same time 
admitting a continuous dependence on parameters which facilitates geometrical modelling. 
These factors allow us to make the hybrid biological models... ...we speculate that when a V -variable 
geometrical fractal model is found that has a good match to the geometry of a given plant, 
then there is a specific relationship between these code trees and the information 
stored in the genes of the plant. &mdash;

<blockquote>
In mathematics, iterated function systems (IFSs) are a method of constructing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractals</a>; 
the resulting fractals are often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similar">self-similar</a>. 
IFS fractals are more related to set theory 
than fractal geometry. They were introduced in 1981. &mdash;
