## Daylight variations
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

This app is a not-to-scale Earth-Sun-Moon simulator, hence
it does not include gravitational physics or Newtonian analysis, 
just circular motion.

Observe not only how fast the length of the day varies, but also
how the speed with which it either increases or decreases varies
throughout the year. Can you explain what you observe? Does the 
model help?
