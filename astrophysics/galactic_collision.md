## Future collision between our Milky Way &amp; Andromeda
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>


In roughly four and a half billion years, our Milky Way galaxy 
[will collide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision) with our nearest
neighbour, the [Andromeda galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy). 

The demo below simulates this future collision. It is based on a very simple model:
- Both galaxy's contain only a very limited amount of stars compared 
  to the real amounts in both galaxy's (1400 for the Milky way and 2800 for the Andromeda)
- No [super-massive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) at the center of either galaxy
- The masses of the stars and their positions are randomly picked from a normal distribution, 
  generated from a uniform distribution using a [Box-MÃ¼ller transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform).
- VPython&apos;s [`simple_sphere`](https://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/sphere.html#simple-sphere) 
  objects are used to optimize performance.

- Wikipedia also contains many pictures and a lot of background information on the upcoming
  [Andromeda and Milky Way collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision)
- [This article](https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-andromeda-and-milky-way-collision-explained/) summarizes
  shortly the possible scenarios for our solar system as well. However, by that time all life will have
  disappeared already on planet Earth, as the sun's luminosity will have increased by over 30% by that time,
  boiling and evaporating the oceans into oblivion.
