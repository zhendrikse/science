### Visualization explained
<div style="border-top: 1px solid #999999"><br/></div>

The application is best described in 
[Ryston&apos;s article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1286/1/012049) itself:


- _Motion of marbles rolling on bend surface affected by actual gravity and friction_ &mdash; 
  naturally, when we use a simulation, we don’t have to deal with non-ideal conditions of real world
  experiments. Point-like particles can be made to move strictly in the surface without friction
  and without any force acting on them, their motion being affected purely by the curvature of the
  surface. To support the idea that the motion is restricted to the surface, it is beneficial to be able
  to flip the whole embedding diagram upside down, a feature that is easily achieved with a
  simulation but hardly with a real aperture.
- _Emphasis on the two-dimensional motion_ &mdash; as we mentioned above, the only physically relevant
  part of the motion is in the horizontal plane (𝑟, 𝜑) or (𝑥, 𝑦), if you will. With a rotatable
  simulation, we can take advantage of a view from the top (looking in the direction of the 𝑧 axis).
  In this view, we see purely the effect of spatial curvature on the motion. Taking advantage of
  the simulation further, we can add a second particle which will follow the motion of the first
  particle but only in the horizontal plane. This way we can point out the difference in the two
  motions and how they are related. It would be most interesting to see such a setup with the
  marbles, but one can imagine achieving that could be extremely difficult.
- _Purely spatial curvature_ &mdash; needless to say, this is the one conceptual obstacle that we cannot
  get rid of when using this type of embedding diagram, and we need to keep it in mind.
  However, what we can do is add another particle moving in the horizontal plane whose motion
  will start with the same initial conditions as the particle on the curved surface but which moves
  according to the complete set of equations of motion for the equatorial plane of Schwarzschild
  spacetime. This mainly means adding the time component, which substantially changes the
  motion. This feature allows the user to, at least qualitatively, compare the “real” motion with
  the one due to space curvature. A practical note: In order to clearly see the curvature of the
  embedding diagram and its effect on the motion, we usually visualize a region of space that is
  very close to the Schwarzschild horizon, which means that the real-motion particle almost
  immediately falls inside the central object. Therefore, this feature serves only as a rough
  comparison of the two motions.
- _Dynamical changes of the curvature_ &mdash; lastly, let us mention a nice feature that is again possible
  only using a computer simulation. By changing the central mass parameter 𝑀 of the curvature
  (see equations above), we can change the curvature dynamically, even during a particles motion.
  While this hardly corresponds to a real world situation (the central gravitating body would have
  to lose mass while remaining spherically symmetric and without rotation), it is an interesting
  feature enabling us to compare trajectories for different curvatures. In other words, we can show
  the perhaps intuitive, fact that larger mass curves space around itself more, resulting in stronger
  curving of the trajectories

### Theoretical background
<div style="border-top: 1px solid #999999"><br/></div>

The Schwarzschild metric describes a gravitational field of a non-rotating 
spherical mass (and without electric charge), see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric):

$\begin{equation}ds^2=cd\tau^2=\left(1-\dfrac{r_s}{r}\right)c^2dt^2-\left(1-\dfrac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2-r^2d\Omega^2\end{equation}$

where

$\begin{equation}d\Omega^2=\left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right) \text{, } r_s=\dfrac{2GM}{c^2}\end{equation}$

and $G$ is Newton’s gravitational constant, $c$ the speed of light and $M$ is the 
mass of the non-rotating spherical object.

When we assume the time to be constant ($dt=0$), we get:

$\begin{equation}ds^2 = \dfrac{dr^2}{1 - \dfrac{2GM}{c^2r}} +r^2d\phi^2\end{equation}$

Now, according to [Ryston&apos;s article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1286/1/012049):

<blockquote>
<p>
In order to visualize the curvature in the 𝑟 direction, we embed this surface into
the three-dimensional Cartesian space (where 𝑟 and 𝜑 are identical to polar coordinates and the third,
vertical Cartesian coordinate 𝑧 is used to visualize the actual curvature – see figure 1 below). As a result, 
we get an equation for the 𝑧 coordinate as a function of 𝑟:</p>

<p>
$z(r)=\sqrt{\dfrac{8GMr}{c^2} - \dfrac{16M^2g^2}{c^4}}$
</p>

<p>Of course, this equation 𝑟 and 𝑧 are in meters, which is not very convenient for visualizing large
regions of space. For this reason, geometricized units where 𝑐 = 𝐺 = 1 are often used. Then we get the
simpler form:</p>

<p>
$z(r) = \sqrt{8Mr - 16M^2}$.

This is the quintessential formula that is used in this visualization:

```python
class SchwarzschildSpaceTime:
    def __init__(self, mass, grid_y_offset=-10):
        self._mass = mass
        # ...
    
    # ...

    def z_as_function_of(self, r):
        return sqrt(8 * self._mass * r - 16 * self._mass * self._mass)


```
