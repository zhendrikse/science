### Julia and Mandelbrot sets explained
<div style="border-top: 1px solid #999999"><br/></div>

Before continuing reading up on Julia sets, please make yourself familiar with
the explanation written on the 
[Mandelbrot set](https://www.hendrikse.name/science/mathematics/mandelbrot.html) 
page first, as these sets are tightly connected with one another. For example,
both sets are generated with iterations of the formula

$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$

The difference is that whereas Mandelbrot images are generated using $z_0=0$, 
Julia sets are generated by varying $z$ while the parameter $c$ is kept constant.
This implies that for each value of $c$, a different Julia set will be generated!

This difference is also neatly addressed in the 
video [Julia Sets, and how they relate to The Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dctJ7ISkU-4), 
which is a follow-up on [The Mandelbrot Set Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MotVcGvFMg).

For our implementation this means that we now have:

```python
# Plotting region
x_min, x_max = -zoom, zoom
y_min, y_max = -zoom, zoom
y = y_min
while y <= y_max:
    x = x_min
    while x <= x_max:
        z = complex_(x, y)
        iteration = 0
        while abs_z_squared(z) < 4 and iteration < max_iter:
            z = z_squared_minus_c(z, c)
            iteration += 1

        if iteration < max_iter and .075 < iteration / max_iter < 1:
            colour = get_color(iteration)
            box(pos=vector(x * width / 4, y * height / 4, 0), color=colour, shininess=0)
```
