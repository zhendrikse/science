<blockquote>
In astrophysics, spaghettification (sometimes referred to as the noodle effect) 
is the vertical stretching and horizontal compression of objects into long thin shapes 
(rather like spaghetti) in a very strong, non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous">homogeneous</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field">gravitational field</a>. 
It is caused by extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force">tidal forces</a>. 
In the most extreme cases, near a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a>, 
the stretching and compression are so powerful that no object can resist it. 
Within a small region, the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching 
so that a small object being spaghettified experiences no net change in volume. &mdash;
