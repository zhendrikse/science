## Harmonograph simulator
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

> A harmonograph is a mechanical apparatus that employs 
[pendulums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum) 
to create a geometric image. The drawings created typically are 
[Lissajous curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve)
or related drawings of greater complexity. The devices, which began to appear in the mid-19th 
century and peaked in popularity in the 1890s, cannot be conclusively attributed to a single person, 
although [Hugh Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Blackburn), 
a professor of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) 
at the [University of Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow), 
is commonly believed to be the official inventor. &mdash;
