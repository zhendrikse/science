## Raindrops falling in a pond

- Based on [this example](https://beltoforion.de/de/unterhaltungsmathematik/2d-wellengleichung.php) 
  from [Recreational Mathematics with Python](https://github.com/beltoforion/recreational_mathematics_with_python)
- Ported to Javascript by [Zeger Hendrikse](https://github.com/zhendrikse/) in 
  [raindrop_waves.html](https://github.com/zhendrikse/science/blob/main/nature/code/raindrop_waves.html">raindrop_waves.html)
- Also available in [VPython](https://vpython.org/) as 
  [raindrop_waves.py](https://github.com/zhendrikse/science/blob/main/nature/code/raindrop_waves.py), but significantly slower!
