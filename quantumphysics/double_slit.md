## [Young&apos;s interference experiment](htpts://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment)

In this visualization, the interference pattern is generated "statically", 
and is therefore assumed to have either already taken place or to have already been executed. 
The two slits are represented by the two spheres that are now firing particles at the screen/detector 
in the simulation, so that the difference in the behavior of particles and waves can be clearly seen.
