## Adiabatic expansion
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

Note that the initial normal distribution of the components of the 
particle velocities does eventually yield a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
of velocities in 3D, see for example 
[this form post](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/19969/how-do-i-generate-maxwell-boltzmann-variates-using-a-uniform-distribution-random).
