## Introduction to manifolds
<div class="header_line"><br/></div>

<blockquote>
<p>
The term “manifold” comes from Riemann’s Mannigfaltigkeit, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”
</p>

<p>
A manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. 
For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. 
Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. 
An ant living on the circle will never know that it’s actually round. 
But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, 
and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point 
that it’s not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; 
zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it’ll look like a flat 2D plane. 
But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected 
at their tips — is not a manifold.
