The term fractal was coined by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) 
from the Latin ‘fractus’, which means broken or fractured.

<blockquote>
Because of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer 
graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the 
Mandelbrot set in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. 
He said that things typically considered to be "rough", a "mess", or "chaotic", 
such as clouds or shorelines, actually had a "degree of order". &mdash;
